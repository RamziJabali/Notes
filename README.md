Java notes
Method attributes: 
# visibility: determines the accesibility of a method or field. I.e, Public, allows a method to be accesed from anywhere. Private is only accessible within the class itself.
# Domain: is the input allowable to a function, the arguments and its types. I.e f(x)= x+2, allows on for intergers to be entered through (x).
# Range: is the output allowable for a function to return, I.e f(x)= x+2, allows only the int x to be returned.
# name of the method.
# implementation: it is the body of the method, the algorithim I.e f(x)= x+2, (x+2)== the algorithim. 

Exercise:
```
	public void printName() {
		System.out.println(nameOne);
	}
  ```
  Visibility (Public)
  
  Domain (N/A)
  
  Range (void)
  
  Name (printName)
  
  implementaion (System.out.println(nameOne);)
  
```
  private int scrambleNumber(int foo) {
	return foo/2*87;
}
```
Visibilty (Private)

Domain (int)

Range (int)

Name (scrambleNum)

Implementation (return foo/2*87;)
